Starting outside, the new concrete walkway guides you into the side entrance where you are met by new gleaming hardwood floors in the main level living room, dining room and the stairs going up to the upper level and down to the basement . The living room fireplace has been thoroughly inspected and draws well. The entire interior has been freshly painted with neutral colors trimmed out with a contrasting semi-gloss white. All of the windows have been replaced with newer double pane windows. There is a new ceiling fan in the dining room. The kitchen has been updated with granite counters and newer cabinets and appliances, and tile floor. The main level full bath has been updated with a newer granite sink and vanity, newer faucet, tile floor and light fixture. The main level bedroom has new carpet. The upstairs bedrooms have new carpet. The full bath with a stand up shower has been updated with a new quartz vanity and sink, light fixture and tile floor. The basement is divided in half. The well-lit finished side includes new LVT, and a sliding glass door that provides natural light and looks out onto a large stone back yard patio. The sliding glass door will be replaced with a new door. On the opposite side there is a storage room with a work bench and an adjacent laundry room with a full size washer and dryer and a utility sink with a new faucet. There is also a sliding glass door that provides natural light and access to the stone patio. This sliding glass door will be replaced, as well. There is a rough-in for a sink and toilet for a 3rd bath. All outlets and GFIs have been replaced throughout the home. There are new floor registers and all of the door knobs have been replaced. The roof was replaced in 2016, the siding was replaced in 2012, the HWH was replaced in 2022, and the HVAC system inside and out was just replaced in 7/2023. The back yard is fenced in and professionally landscaped and the large stone patio has been power washed. There are two parking spaces in front that provide easy access to the home.

       "       'review': \"My children have been attending MSHR since 2007. My youngest child started started at Children's House, the preschool campus of MSHR. It was such a huge improvement from his last preschool, it made me rethink the experience my older son was having in the Falls Church City Public school system. I decided to pull my older son from public school and start him at MSHR for first grade. It was one of the best decisions I have made for my children. I never intended to keep my children in private school as we live in a very good school district, but I found Montessori to be a very good fit for our family. Last year my oldest son graduated from the Middle School program. I had not planned on keeping him at MSHR for Middle School, as I thought it was too small and would limit his peer group. As he approached the difficult middle school (teen) years, I discovered that limiting his peer group was a advantage and helped him to mature. He had plenty of friends both in and out of school, but he was able to avoid some of the peer pressure and bullying that comes from a larger less controlled environment. He was able to get individual attention from his teacher, but at the same time was allowed to be independent. He is now a Freshman at Paul VI High School and is doing very well. His younger brother will graduate from MSHR middle school this year and join him at PVI. I am very proud of both my boys and I feel that MSHR has done a great job preparing them for the bigger world and the rest of their academic career.\",\n",

       "       'review': 'MSHR is a FANTASTIC school! If you are looking for a true Montessori education for your child, this is absolutely the place. I have two children in the school. My older child started at age 3 in their Children\\'s House, and is now in 2nd Grade at their Upper School. My younger child, age 3, is in the Children\\'s House preschool program. I am amazed every day at the work they are doing. My older child is doing long division in the 2nd grade! Your child works at their own pace, guided by expert Montessori teachers who truly care. My older child was briefly in another preschool before we found MSHR and needless to say, it was awful. The \"teachers\" were inexperienced and it was a chaotic environment. When we made the switch to MSHR, we were amazed at the serene environment that they manage to create. We sent our older child to a summer program at a fancy, expensive school in the area this past summer, and while the facilities were amazing and the staff was nice, my son every day told me how much he just wanted to go back to his school. That pretty much says it all. If you want a school that your child will want to go to everyday, MSHR is the place.',\n",

I have 2 children attending MSHR one in 3rd grade and one in 4th grade both with very different needs. My older son has focus problems. He spent one year in public school where he was singled out for not focusing but was offered no assistance or direction. At MSHR his attention is gently redirected back to his school work and his teachers have taught him how to limit his distractions and guided him to success by giving him obtainable goals and encouragement. My younger son is very bright and needs constant challenging or he gets into trouble. The teachers have recognized this and let him go at his own pace while presenting him with new challenges when needed.The Montessori approach lets each child get what they need and gives them consistent feedback and direction. I highly recommend MSHR.',\n",

My son has an IEP for speech and he's shown so much positive growth over the last 3 years, it's been really encouraging. He loves to learn and be social and this school and the teachers have really embraced him for who he is. The principal has been responsive and friendly. The SACC program for before and after school care at the school was fantastic, as well. I'll also say that diversity is something that is important to us as a family as we move around, and this school celebrates student heritage and culture with a Heritage Night and we loved it!On a safety note, I appreciated that the front doors are locked and a camera is there to monitor visitors. I felt safe sending my son there.\",\n",

If you have a child in this school, be prepared to teach your children any and all concepts that are supposed to be taught in school. Otherwise, your child will be disadvantaged. If you are planning to move to this area specifically for this school, please do yourself a favor and reconsider your options. You will be greatly disappointed.

Whatever the reason, I would strongly argue that the score for this school underrepresents the quality of the education here.

       "       'review': \"I have a freshman and a sophomore enrolled who also attended the middle school. Great school overall, with awesome programs and teachers. Academically, the honors program is rigorous and the AP program appears to be challenging (my oldest hasn't taken an AP test yet to confirm). The music program is second to none - I have one kid in orchestra and the community they built is outstanding. The sports program is amazing, one of my kids joined cross-county and has blossomed and continued with indoor track, partly because of the good-natured and kind kids but also due to a great coach. My other kid tried out for swimming but didn't make it - super fast team, kids from Nation's Capitol and other clubs didn't make it in - but the coach encouraged trying out next year. My kid's likely to join crew instead this year. Overall, options and more options to grow. It's not a fire and forget school - you need to stay on top of politically sensitive issues that the county tries to throw your way and decide what's best for your kid / you need to stay on top of your kid's social choices and all kids seem to have cells (not mine - yet). If your kid is into STEM, you need to stay on top of options (science/chemistry olympiad, clubs, etc.) to enhance their experience. If your kid is struggling with a subject (e.g. math), you need to stay on top of tutoring or deciding whether to tone it from honors to general education. I guess my only ding for Lake Braddock is that counselors will not hold your kid's hand through these tough decision or even identify the problems. It's not like a private school, but if you're willing to supplement the extra guidance you get a heck of a deal!\",\n",

She gets art every day, music, drama, Spanish, and field trips. Uniforms are so nice to have, given the materialistic world we all live in. Can't say enough good things, wish this school went through 6th grade.\",\n",

       "       'review': \"I have a freshman and a sophomore enrolled who also attended the middle school. Great school overall, with awesome programs and teachers. Academically, the honors program is rigorous and the AP program appears to be challenging (my oldest hasn't taken an AP test yet to confirm). The music program is second to none - I have one kid in orchestra and the community they built is outstanding. The sports program is amazing, one of my kids joined cross-county and has blossomed and continued with indoor track, partly because of the good-natured and kind kids but also due to a great coach. My other kid tried out for swimming but didn't make it - super fast team, kids from Nation's Capitol and other clubs didn't make it in - but the coach encouraged trying out next year. My kid's likely to join crew instead this year. Overall, options and more options to grow. It's not a fire and forget school - you need to stay on top of politically sensitive issues that the county tries to throw your way and decide what's best for your kid / you need to stay on top of your kid's social choices and all kids seem to have cells (not mine - yet). If your kid is into STEM, you need to stay on top of options (science/chemistry olympiad, clubs, etc.) to enhance their experience. If your kid is struggling with a subject (e.g. math), you need to stay on top of tutoring or deciding whether to tone it from honors to general education. I guess my only ding for Lake Braddock is that counselors will not hold your kid's hand through these tough decision or even identify the problems. It's not like a private school, but if you're willing to supplement the extra guidance you get a heck of a deal!\",\n",

As a student with a 504 plan, for the most part it has been respected and implemented properly. The school is safe, and we have regular drills and very clear procedures. I will point out a few problems: This is an achievement-oriented school and there is a lot of pressure on us to take Honors, AP, DE, and get straight A\\'s, be in honor societies, and be on a sport\\'s team. They are trying to support student mental health and wellness, but the time where we did that was when we can work on assignments and study for tests. The teachers care about our mental health, but the student mental health lessons aren\\'t helpful. This led to more stress because we had less time for our assignments, and we get a lot of them and I have had up to three tests in one day. Incidents where students use offensive humor (racist, sexist, homophobic, ablest \"jokes\") should be taken more seriously. On multiple accounts, I have heard my peers use the r-slur, racial slurs, racist jokes or say \"special ed\" as a derogatory term.',\n",

I went to WSHS because of bullying issues at South County. The atmosphere at WSHS is very welcoming and pushes students, sometimes a bit much, to succeed. Nearly every person from my class went to and finished college. Many of us, including myself, also went to graduate schools. WSHS pushes students to succeed academically and puts a huge emphasis on AP courses. AP courses help the school, but not the students; always try for dual enrollment instead! WSHS is a fairly diverse school that celebrates differences. Being a new student, I struggled at first to make friends but joining clubs and athletic programs is the easiest way to meet people and “fit in” at WSHS. WSHS is like all high schools: there are popular kids, kids who do drugs, kids who do very well, and kids who slack off, but I found this school to have majority of its students really want to succeed. Looking back at my time as a student, I realize just how much my teachers cared and that the homework I thought was so difficult was actually fairly manageable (despite the AP courses). I enjoyed my time at WSHS and met many wonderful people there.',\n",

       "       'review': \"I was a former student at this school. Teachers are not effective and a lot of them seem inexperienced. They didn't really teach, just handed out packets to do. There were some good teachers, but most of them were mediocre and subpar. Teachers also favored certain students even if they were not worthy of a good grade. Especially the English department, they did not prepare me for college writing. They rewarded basic levels of writing that was below what advanced writing should be. A lot of teachers dumbed down the material and if you were to write above their basic standards, they would give you a lower grade. Multiple teachers I had got frustrated easily and did not take the time to teach. They seemed easily overwhelmed and did not do their job. Whenever I tried to meet them after school, they would ignore me and not show up at all. If they did meet me, it was only for a couple of minutes. Multiple teachers did this throughout my four years. When asked a question they would get frustrated and would not explain. Teachers rushed through material and didn't take the time to teach the new concepts. The counseling office didn't know how to help with the college process and did not give helpful information in regards to preparing us. Overall a below average experience.\",\n",

Students pass classes without any real knowledge of the subject and then move on to the next class, only to struggle and yet keep getting passed on. There are too many opportunities to pass in late work and retake tests, and this isn't preparing students for the real world and as such they are struggling in college. There are no consequences for student issues like tardies, cheating, disrespect, and leaving campus. The principal seems concerned with pushing his agenda through and doesn't seem to want feedback from parents, students, or teachers. And there is way too much emphasis on the state tests.\",\n",

My son's classes range in size from four to eight students, so they get a lot of individual attention. The small class size also allows the teachers to cover the material in class and homework is therefore much less than in public school. The teachers really care about the students and want them to do well. There are also alot of clubs and sports for my son to participate in, including drama, robotics, and basketball. He actually looks forward to school everyday. If your child is unhappy in his current school, you should take a look at GW.\",\n",

       "       'review': \"I have a freshman and a sophomore enrolled who also attended the middle school. Great school overall, with awesome programs and teachers. Academically, the honors program is rigorous and the AP program appears to be challenging (my oldest hasn't taken an AP test yet to confirm). The music program is second to none - I have one kid in orchestra and the community they built is outstanding. The sports program is amazing, one of my kids joined cross-county and has blossomed and continued with indoor track, partly because of the good-natured and kind kids but also due to a great coach. My other kid tried out for swimming but didn't make it - super fast team, kids from Nation's Capitol and other clubs didn't make it in - but the coach encouraged trying out next year. My kid's likely to join crew instead this year. Overall, options and more options to grow. It's not a fire and forget school - you need to stay on top of politically sensitive issues that the county tries to throw your way and decide what's best for your kid / you need to stay on top of your kid's social choices and all kids seem to have cells (not mine - yet). If your kid is into STEM, you need to stay on top of options (science/chemistry olympiad, clubs, etc.) to enhance their experience. If your kid is struggling with a subject (e.g. math), you need to stay on top of tutoring or deciding whether to tone it from honors to general education. I guess my only ding for Lake Braddock is that counselors will not hold your kid's hand through these tough decision or even identify the problems. It's not like a private school, but if you're willing to supplement the extra guidance you get a heck of a deal!\",\n",

The focus has shifted from teaching our kids solid foundations of math, science, history and English, to a politically correct mush of mediocrity. Independent though is discouraged and stifled. Leadership is weak and politically motivated.',\n",

       "       'review': \"I have a freshman and a sophomore enrolled who also attended the middle school. Great school overall, with awesome programs and teachers. Academically, the honors program is rigorous and the AP program appears to be challenging (my oldest hasn't taken an AP test yet to confirm). The music program is second to none - I have one kid in orchestra and the community they built is outstanding. The sports program is amazing, one of my kids joined cross-county and has blossomed and continued with indoor track, partly because of the good-natured and kind kids but also due to a great coach. My other kid tried out for swimming but didn't make it - super fast team, kids from Nation's Capitol and other clubs didn't make it in - but the coach encouraged trying out next year. My kid's likely to join crew instead this year. Overall, options and more options to grow. It's not a fire and forget school - you need to stay on top of politically sensitive issues that the county tries to throw your way and decide what's best for your kid / you need to stay on top of your kid's social choices and all kids seem to have cells (not mine - yet). If your kid is into STEM, you need to stay on top of options (science/chemistry olympiad, clubs, etc.) to enhance their experience. If your kid is struggling with a subject (e.g. math), you need to stay on top of tutoring or deciding whether to tone it from honors to general education. I guess my only ding for Lake Braddock is that counselors will not hold your kid's hand through these tough decision or even identify the problems. It's not like a private school, but if you're willing to supplement the extra guidance you get a heck of a deal!\",\n",
